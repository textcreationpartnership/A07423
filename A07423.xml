            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AFter the three Greeke words, wee will explaine three Latin, and begin backwadrs, to the end that one may deriue the one fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> the other. The firſt therefore ſhalbe the Sacrament, marueilous agreable to this actio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>. For <hi>Feſtus</hi> witneſſeth that the ancients vſurped it in actions which they performed with an oath. For when they entred Soldiers in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to their Rowle, they exacted an oath either of euery one in particular, or of the whole band in groſſe; this they ſtiled a conjuration, becauſe they ſware altogether, or particularly, and theſe oathes they termed, <hi>military Sacraments,</hi>

                  <hi>inde ſacramento liberati.</hi> From hence it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth, that Chriſtian Souldiers which are the truly faithfull, preſenting themſelues in Baptiſme to bee enrowled, and at the Supper, to muſter and receiue preſſe-money in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litant Church, haue termed theſe actions Sacraments: and becauſe it is ſufficient to be once enrowled, Baptiſme is not to be reiterated, but in as much as Soldiers are often to mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, to make open profeſſion, to beare the colours, and to take the bread of munition during this ſpirituall warfare, thereupon it is, that this Sacrament of the Supper is often to be reiterated; in which on Gods behalfe wee are aſſured by the truth of his Word, by the exhibiting of his pledge, by the character of his Seale, by the efficacy of his Spirit, that he loues vs in his Sonne, will be fauourable vnto vs through his obedience, will exalt vs in his fauour through the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility of his Lambe ſacrificed vpon the Croſſe. And againe on our parts, we accept that grace, we proteſt that we will abide conſtant, we ſweare that wee will ſerue ſo good an Head, that we will loue and honour ſuch a Father, and that we will renounce ſathan and his promiſes, the world and its delights. Now if you conſider it in its <hi>matter,</hi> it wilbe double, to wit in ſignes; and in that which they ſignifie, which is called the matter of the Sacrament. The ſigne in
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:1522:10"/> Baptiſme is the water, the thing which is ſignified is Blood; the ſigne in the Supper is Bread and Wine, the thing ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied is the Body and Blood; neuertheleſſe in regard of the Sacramentall vnion, which the ſigne and the thing ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed have one with another, they borrow one anothers name in this action; ſometimes the Body is called the Bread, ſom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times the Bread, the Body.

                  <hi>CHAP. VIII.</hi> Tho ancient forme of celebrating the Supper, practiſed at this day in the reformed Church.</head>
               <p>BY vnderſtanding the ſeuerall names of the Supper, one might well apprehend the ſubſtance of it, to wit, that it is a diuine inſtitution, proceeding from our Sauiour, who in the Sacrament of a common Supper, celebrated by the Church, hath diſpoſed of the matter, forme, &amp; end ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. The <hi>matter</hi> is double, the one viſible and corruptible, which is receiued with the hand, and entreth into the body by the mouth of the faithfull, to wit, the Bread and Wine. The other inuiſible and incorruptible, to wit, the body bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, and the Bloud of Ieſus ſhed vpon the Croſſe, which is applyed to the ſoule of the faithfull, for their ſanctification and redemption. As for the <hi>forme,</hi> it is preſcribed in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, on the paſtors part to take the bread into his handes to bleſſe it, breake it, &amp; diſtribute it to the people, likewiſe to take the Wine, to bleſſe it, and giue it to all the Church to drinke thereof, which are capable of it, and to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie vnto them the benefite of that Sacrament. On the part of the faithfull,<note place="margin">Math. 26. Mar. 14. Luke 22.1. Cor. 11.</note> hauing examined themſelues, they ought to preſent themſelues to that holy communion, take it, eate and drinke that viſible element with the mourh of their body, and by faith to participate of the body &amp; blood of our Saviour, apprehend the merit of his death, the effect of his reſurrection, and the efficacy of his aſcenſion. As for the <hi>End,</hi> it is to magnifie the bountie of God, to render him
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:1522:14"/> thanks, to accept his accordment made in the new Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to receaue there the pledge and aſſurance of a better life, to proteſt our fidelitie to his ſervice, from the vnion which we haue with him, then with his myſticall body the Church, receauing from him our ſpirituall nouriſhment, &amp; ſo participating of that quickning bread, to wit, all his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, his wiſdome, his iuſtice, his ſanctification &amp; redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So then the vnion which we haue with our Saviour is reall, but that is as much to ſay as <hi>reipſa,</hi> for in regard of the veritie of it, we are vnited vnto him, and it is likewiſe ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall in reſpect of the meanes whereby it is wrought, which is the ſpirit and faith. With this truth and this ſimplicity the faithfull of the firſt ages contented themſelues, and if they vſed the termes of ſacrifice and oblation, it was not either to play the Pagans or Iewes, much leſſe to crucify againe our Saviour, as it hath beene proued before. But as falſhood is an ape of the truth, the ſpirit of error hath falſified this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament, ſtrucke of her ſeales, turned the things bequeathed to other vſes, depriued the legataries of their legacies, inſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted divers clauſes to their owne profit, and to be briefe hath ſo diſguiſed and adulterated the coppies, that from thence one can no more expect ayd for his ſalvation. Wherefore the truely faithfull, doe charge that inſtrument with falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, haue recourſe to the firſt draught of it in the Goſpel, and take no leſſe care of the ſalvation of their ſoules, then of the keeping of an heritage, fearing as much falſe doctrine as to receaue falſe coyne, &amp; righting themſelues from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the forgers themſelues, doe finde great light for the diſcovery of theſe falſhoods. To this purpoſe confeſſed an ancient Abbot,<note place="margin">Rupert. Tuit. l. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>21.</hi>

                  <hi>that the Maſſe was not celebrated in times paſt with ſuch apparell as it is now adaies, and that it was not poliſht by one alone in ſuch ſort as it is now. &amp;c. and that it is not a whit the holyer for that, conſidering that heretofore it was conſecrated only with the words of our Lord, and ioyning of the Lords prayer.</hi> And a Biſhop of Rome ſaith,<note place="margin">Greg. epiſt. ex reg. lib. <hi>7.</hi> c. <hi>63.</hi> Platin. in Xiſto.</note> 
                  <hi>the Lords prayer is ſaid incontinently after the other prayers, becauſe the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles were accuſtomed to conſecrate the oblation of the hoſt, in
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:1522:15"/> ſaying only the Lords prayer.</hi> Whence it appeares, that the body of the Maſſe which is the Canon, is not at all eſſentiall vnto it, and that the ſoule of it which is tranſubſtantiation, was not infuſed into that body, vntill by the Councell of Lateran, in the yeare 1205. We muſt therefore here reſume the firſt paths, we muſt take away the hay, durt, and ſtrawe from this building, and ioine our ſelues to the foundation of the Apoſtles: doing like thoſe which goe aſtray &amp; return by their owne ſteps to finde the true way. Wee ſhall finde <hi>Iuſtin Martyr</hi> writing about an hundred and ſixtie yeares after the birth of Chriſt, and wee ſhall note in reading him, that water was mingled with the wine about 40 yeares be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,<note place="margin">Iuſtin.

Afterwards the reader hauing left off to read, hee which is preſident in the aſſembly makes an exhortation to the people in a Sermon, admoniſhing them to imitate thoſe good things; after that is finiſhed, all doe riſe vp together, and make our prayers vnto God</hi> (hee ſaith not to any Saint) <hi>and as we ſaid before, that prayer being done, the bread, the wine, and the water are brought forth, and hee that performeth that action, pronounceth with all his might, prayers and thanksgiuings, the people there ioyne their voices, their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections and their bleſſing, ſaying Amen. Then a diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made to every one, and a communication of thoſe things which were bleſſed with thanksgiuing.</hi>

And as for the ſupper, wee ſee how that that hath beene caſheerd by the Maſſe, the tables of wood by the tables of ſtone, the Churches ſimplicitie by Iewiſh and heatheniſh ſuperſtition, although ſome of theſe things might at the firſt haue beene introduced with a good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.

                  <hi>both in that hee made an Ephod contrary to the word of God, and in that he ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the abuſe of it, tooke it not away. Now who ſeeth not that the like hapneth in the Church? how many things haue the Saints ordained with a good intent, which we ſee at this day changed, partly through abuſe, partly through ſuperſtition? for example ſake, the Feaſts, Ceremonies, Images, Maſſe, Monaſteries &amp;c. None of theſe were inſtituted in that ſort at the firſt, as now they are vſed &amp;c. and yet we Gedeons hold our peaces, they take not away the abuſe, they take not away the ſuperſtition.</hi> Poore Cordelier, when thou wroteſt this at <hi>Ments,</hi> hadſt thou preached it at <hi>Rome,</hi> thou wouldſt haue hardly eſcaped the fagot. Now that we haue repreſented that which was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed and practiſed anciently, let vs ſee what at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent is acted in the Church of <hi>Rome:</hi> and afterward, we will make a briefe compariſon of them both.</p>

               <p n="1">1 The firſt is <hi>the invention of Roman Prieſts,</hi> which co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in ſtrange tongues, in the compoſition of the Canon or body of the Maſſe, in tranſubſtantiation which is its ſoule, in elevation, adoration, proceſſions, feaſt of the ſacrament, in prayer for the dead, in the anointing and conſecrating of of the Prieſts fingers, and in the ſtanding of the Angell <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> at the right corner of the alter.</p>
               <p n="2">2 The ſecond is <hi>Paganiſme,</hi> which appeares in the ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uings of the Prieſts, in their abſtaining from marrying, in their ſituating of the Temple towards the Eaſt, in burning of tapers and their ſmoke, in images and their conſecration, and laſtly in offering of dowe and bread for the remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="3">3 The third is <hi>Iudaiſme,</hi> which lies in their alters, Prieſts, and Levites, for Cardinall <hi>Baronius,</hi> and Pope Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent the third doe both agree, that they borrowed theſe ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies from Iewes and Pagans.</p>
               <p n="4">4 The fourth is <hi>Magicke,</hi> which conſiſts in vneven nu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, in prayers, ſignes, and words conſecrating the hoſt: al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo in turnes and whirles, intentions and reſpirations of the Prieſt, in reciteals and repetitions of <hi>Kyrieeliſon,</hi> of <hi>agnus,</hi> &amp; <hi>mea culpa,,</hi> of prayers to gaine 164 yeares of pardon, with ſo many more daies ordained by <hi>Gregory, Nicolas,</hi> and <hi>Leo</hi> the 10, ioyning 7 paternoſters, and 7 Avemaria's, where we may conceaue that either the day of iudgement will not come yet this good while, or if it doe, we may wonder what will become of all their proviſion of Indulgences? Magicke beſides is to be found in their ſalted water, and in the vertue of the fumes of their incenſe, effectuall even againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and laſtly, in that the Prieſts hold, that if there be more water then wine, if the wine be naught, if the bread bee not
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:1522:16"/> of wheat, or if it hath beene ſteeped in any other liquor be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides water that then they will not tranſubſtantiate.</p>
               <p n="5">5 The fift is the corruption of the <hi>Matter,</hi> in as much as in the whole Maſſe there is found no ſacrament: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides that they put water into the wine contrary to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of a councell, and abridge the people of the wine, they make of it another matter, to wit, Chriſts perſon viſible and inviſible incloſed in a wafercake.</p>
               <p n="6">6 The ſixt, is the <hi>Forme</hi> changed and perverted, there being a low voice during the moſt part of the action, where as <hi>Iuſtinian</hi> ordained a loud: then many little wafers inſteed of a large loafe, conſecration without a Communion, many alters in liew of one table, bleſſed bread inſteed of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, purifying wine inſteed of the wine to the layicke, not touching nor breaking the bread giuen to the people, kiſſing a peece of plate as it it were equipollent to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, and in briefe, vſing the people worſe then leapers were heretofore.</p>
               <p n="7">7. The ſeuenth is, the <hi>End</hi> perverted, for the Supper is a Communion, and the Maſſe is an excommunication of the people, a <hi>worke worked</hi> by the Prieſt, by declyning <hi>Miſſa,</hi> &amp; applying his worke to whom it pleaſeth him, to man, beaſt, wood, corne, &amp;c. and inſteed of commemorating onely our Saviour, the Maſſe is a commemoration of men, nayles, croſſe, and the robe without ſeame.</p>
               <p n="8">8 The eighth conſiſts in the <hi>Sacrifice of the Bread and Wine,</hi> before they be conſecrated, and that for remiſſion of ſinnes.</p>
               <p n="9">9 The ninth is the reiterating of the <hi>Expiatory ſacrifice</hi> and ſubrogation of a Prieſt for Ieſus Chriſt the eternall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificer.</p>
               <p n="10">10 The tenth conſiſts in <hi>Blasphemies,</hi> by prophaning the titles proper to God, and our Saviour, and applying of them to creatures in the entrances, and other peeces of the Maſſes of Saints.</p>
               <p n="11">11 The eleuenth is <hi>a renouncing of the only mediator,</hi> &amp; the imploying of a peece of his death, without certaine
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:1522:17"/> knowledge whether it bee meant of him or of ſome other Saint, whether it be meritorious, &amp; whether the oyle of his lampe will profit vs any more the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> it did the fooliſh Virgins.</p>

Againe in the Prieſt elevating of himſelfe aboue his ſacrifice after the conſecration, interceding for the conſecrated hoſt pretended to be deifyed, requeſting of God that it may be as acceptable as the ſacrifice of <hi>Abel,</hi> &amp; of <hi>Melchizedecke</hi> applying that wholy to the Virgin Mary which appertaineth to none but God. Breaking according to their doctrine the bones of Chriſt, and making him to feele corruption, and be ſubiect even to beaſts, deifying of ſpiders, ſlyes, &amp;c,</p>
               <p n="13">13 The thirteenth is in <hi>Forgeries,</hi> adding and dimini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing the teſtament of our Saviour, and changing his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the end that they may qualifie the ſacrificer and his ſacrifices, and alſo in falſifying of the canon of S. <hi>Ambroſe.</hi>

For if wee ought to doe that onely in the ſupper which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded vs to doe, and that which he commanded vs, is that which he did with his Apoſtles the day before hee ſuffered, as ſaith the Canon of the Maſſe, <hi>pridie quam pateretur,</hi> wee ought not to offer vp bread vnto God for the remiſſion of ſinnes. For Ieſus did it not, neither commanded it, neither purchaſed our ſalvation by the oblation of a cake not bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, but with his owne body, and that not at the table, but on the croſſe, not by elevation of bread, but by the effuſion of his bloud, and ſeparation of his ſoule.<note place="margin">Eſ. 53.</note> For <hi>he poured out his ſoule vnto death, and made his ſoule an offering for ſinne,</hi> ſaith <hi>Eſay,</hi> this oblation therefore is vnſufficient in it ſelfe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out commandment, and without example.</p>
               <p>Neither doe the two obiections availe which commonly are here produc't. The firſt whereof is taken out of <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.<note place="margin">Gen. 14</note> where it is ſaid that <hi>Abraham</hi> returning from the defeating of his enimies, the king of <hi>Sodome</hi> went out to meet him, as alſo did <hi>Melchiſedeck</hi> the king of Salem, who brought forth bread and wine and bleſſed him. For the bread and the wine were brought forth to refreſh him and his men which retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned from the warre, and not to bee ſacrificed vnto God, much leſſe vnto <hi>Abraham.</hi> For although it be there added, that <hi>Melchiſedecke</hi> was the Prieſt of the moſt high God yet that was only to ſhew the reaſon why hee receaued tythes of him, and why he bleſſed him, and not to cauſe vs to ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine a ſacrifice. Firſt becauſe there was none ſuch vnder the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:1522:26"/> law, and therefore <hi>Melchiſedecke</hi> in ſo doing had enterpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to forge a new one: ſecondly, the words will not beare it, for the tranſlation of the Septuagint hath it, <gap reason="foreign">

                  <hi>he ſet before him bread and wine:</hi> and it is not ſaid <hi>for he was a Priest,</hi> but <hi>now</hi> or <hi>and he was a Prieſt,</hi> which was the cauſe wherefore he bleſſed <hi>Abraham,</hi> and not where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he preſented him with bread and wine, alſo the whole text runneth, that <hi>Melchiſedecke</hi> brought forth bread, to whom? to <hi>Abraham,</hi> and bleſſed, whom? <hi>Abraham,</hi> and that compariſon which S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes betweene our high Prieſt,<note place="margin">Heb. 7.</note> Chriſt Ieſus, and <hi>Melchiſedecke,</hi> conſiſts not in the offering of bread and wine, but in that he is eternal without father in regard of his humanitie, and without mother in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of his divinitie. Neither is the other obiection of any force, which is taken out of <hi>Malachy,</hi> that amongſt the Ge<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

                  <hi>Muctar</hi> and <hi>Mincha,</hi> that is incenſe &amp; a pure offering. For this <hi>Mincha,</hi> kneaded with flowre and oyle, is ceremoniall, and aboliſhed, neither is the bread which the Roman Prieſts doe offer vp at this day tempred in that ſort. But that ſame prophecy is allegoricall, as is that of <hi>Micah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Micah. 4.1.</note> who prophecied that men ſhould aſcend to Ieruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, to the mountaine of the Lord: ſeeing the Church is catholike, and not incloſed within Iury. So likewiſe that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe which aſcends in the preſence of God ſignifieth the prayers of the faithfull, as wee may obſerue in the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, where it is ſaid, <hi>that another Angell</hi> (to wit our Saviour) <hi>ſtood at the altar hauing a golden cenſer,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Apoc. 8.3.</note> 
                  <hi>the ſmoke whereof, which was the prayers of the Saints, aſcended vp before God out of the Angells hand.</hi> Finally, if our Sauiour had offered bread and wine for the remiſſion of ſinnes, it would follow that our Lord Ieſus had offered twice, &amp; by a conſequence had twice ſatisfied God his father, and paid twice the ſame debt, contrary to that which ſaith <hi>S. Paul, By one oblation he hath perfected for ever them that are ſanctified.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 9.12. &amp; 10. v. 14.</note> Otherwiſe the offring on the croſſe had ſerued to ſmall purpoſe, for it is cer<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>taine that God had heard his wel beloued the firſt time, with out expoſing him to the croſſe, if the offring of bread had
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:1522:26"/> beene ſufficient, as it would haue beene, if he had offered it. And from hence wee may conclude that the Prieſts make two oblations, the firſt of bread and wine not bleſſed, not broken, not taken, not diſtributed; and the ſecond they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to make of the very body of our Sauiour; which errour proceeded from hence, that in the Primatiue Church they v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the word Oblation, giuing the bread not immediatly to God, but to the Prieſt, who did take thereof for the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                  <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion, and diſtributed the reſt to the members of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour, which are the poore. Thus the equiuocall accepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the word, cauſed this horrible ſacriledge. See what more appertaines to this point in the Chapters of <hi>oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and of <hi>ſacrifice.</hi> Beſides, to offer, was taken for as much as to giue to the people which communicated: and in that ſenſe ſome of the ancients tooke it, as amongſt the reſt Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> who writing againſt the minglers of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with wine in the cup, which they offred vnto the people, contrary to the practice of the Primatiue Church, ſaith,<note place="margin">Cypr. contra Aquarios, &amp; epiſt. <hi>68.</hi> ad Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilium.</note>

               <p>This mingling of wine with water was one of the firſt errours that was brought into the Supper, about the yeare of our Lord 120, againſt which one might apply the wordes of <hi>Cyprian</hi> aboue mentioned, who would haue vs to keepe our ſelues in that which our Sauiour inſtituted; See <hi>Iuſtin</hi> in his 2.

Moreouer, if the Prieſt be partaker of the diuinity of Chriſt, as Chriſt himſelfe of the humanity, it would follow that he ſhould be true God, ſeeing that Ieſus is truely man. Thirdly, with what aſſurance can he demand to be heard by the vertue of that myſtery, and that mixture of wine and water, conſidering that it is a thing which God hath not onely not commanded, but alſo hath beene con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by many Councels,<note place="margin">4 Councell of Ort. in the time of Pela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gius.</note> in theſe wordes. <hi>That no man preſume to offer any thing for the oblation of the bleſſed Cuppe, but that onely which he beleeueth to be of the fruit of the Vine, and that without being mingled with water.

                  <hi>Leo</hi> the third brought in this cenſing, which was a thing much practiſed amongſt the Gentiles, <hi>Thure Deum placa,</hi> the canon ſaith, <hi>appeaſe God with incenſe, and ſpare the calfe.</hi> Thus 800 yeeres after the baniſhing of this creature the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe,<note place="margin">Plat. c. <hi>171.</hi> in vita Xiſti.</note> out of the Church, the Prieſt reuiues it againe, and alleadgeth Pſalmes of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who ſubſtituted his pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the place of incenſe, hauing reference through his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticke ſpirit, to that which ought to bee practiſed in the Goſpell, whereas the Prieſt doth take the ſhadow and the ſmoake for the ſubſtance and the truth. Like to this is the ſtanding of <hi>Michael</hi> at the right corner of the Altar, who if he take vp that place, he ſeemes to take part with the Iewes; for <hi>Durand</hi> ſaith, that by the right corner of the Altar the Iewes are prefigured, and by the left the Gentiles. Now note,<note place="margin">Blond. lib. <hi>1.</hi> Alex. ab Alex. lib. <hi>4.</hi> c. <hi>17.</hi> Lib. Pontif. in Sergio. Theod. l. <hi>3.</hi> c. <hi>15.</hi>
                  </note> that in the ſacrifice of <hi>Ianus,</hi> there was a little veſſell named <hi>Canora,</hi> with which they cenſed the Altar, the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and the hoſte; &amp; to imitate this, <hi>Sergius</hi> the Pope gaue a golden cenſer for the perfuming of Maſſes, to the end that he might Iudaize, Paganize, and imitate <hi>Iulian</hi> the Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ta, who brought in incenſe to deſpite the Chriſtians, which neuer vſed it in their Churches. Now that incenſe is one of thoſe ceremonies which ought to be abrogated, it appeares by that which S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, Heb. 9. v. 8.<note place="margin">Heb. 9. v. 8.</note> for there are ſome things which are conſtituted for a time onely, and are for that time, becauſe they take their vertue and efficacy from their inſtitution, and not from their owne nature, as the dirt wherewith our Sauiour anointed the eyes of the blinde, the which ought ſtill to be put in practice, by the ſame reaſon
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:1522:29"/> that incenſe is now to be vſed, for now it is growne to bee a kinde of charme, to chaſe away the diuell with ſmoake, and to heale bodyly diſeaſes: neither (to ſay the truth) appertai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth it to any but ſuch as ſell ſmoke, to publiſh it, and to ſuch as Chamelion-like feede vpon the aire, to beleeue it.

                  </note> it appeares by the teſtimony of the Emperour <hi>Constantine, ſuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is the ſacrifice of the Euchariſt, without blood, without any violence, and there is not required any odour of incenſe, neither any burning fire:</hi> and S. <hi>Auſtine</hi> ſaith, <hi>See how we are without care,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leu. 5. v. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>we need not goe any more to fetch incenſe in Arabia &amp;c.</hi> Finally; the Iewes themſelues, neuer burned incenſe at ſuch ſacrifices as were made for ſin, but onely at meere thankſgiuings; wherefore this action is contrary to the inuention of the Prieſt, who pretendeth to ſacrifize in the Maſſe an oblation for the ſinnes of the liuing and of the dead.</p>
               <p>In waſhing his hands the Prieſt ſaith,
<q>
                     <p>I will waſh my handes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the innocent, and will compaſſe about thine Altar, O Lord: that I may heare the voyce of praiſe, and tell of all thy marueilous things.</p>

               <p>Three abuſes may bee found in this place; the firſt is the retayning of Altars, which being a Iewiſh ceremony, ought to be aboliſhed. The ſecond is the taking of the Prophets words in a wrong ſenſe,<note place="margin">Pſal. 143.</note> who intended not to iuſtifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe before God; for in that ſenſe, <hi>no man liuing ſhalbee iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified:</hi> and that's the reaſon wherefore he prayes, <hi>Enter not into iudgement with thy ſeruant O Lord;</hi> but he made a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſon betweene his owne cauſe, and that of his enemies. As when in the like caſe he ſaid, <hi>if I haue rewarded euill vnto him that was at peace with me, &amp;c.</hi> Wee muſt therefore di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh betweene the innocency of a man towards God, which can no-where be found,<note place="margin">Pſal. 7.</note> and the innocency of a man in regard of his perſecuters, which may well bee granted. The third abuſe is, that whereas the receiuing of this Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is a medicine to thoſe which feele their diſeaſe, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge their ſinnes, and craue pardon of God for them,<note place="margin">Math. 18.</note> as did the poore Publican: the Prieſt heere teacheth
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:1522:30"/> the people the quite contrary, and practiſeth the doctrine of the Phariſee, proteſting his owne innocency and theirs which compaſſe him about, and which fill both his hands and his kitchen with gifts, whereof ſpeakes that verſe: otherwiſe it ſeemes that he would not ſay Maſſe at all, and in that he imitateth <hi>Geheza,</hi> and <hi>Simon Magus.</hi> We may not here omit, that <hi>Gloria patri,</hi> is not ſaid in Maſſes for the dead nor in that of the paſſion. You may geſſe wherefore. This being ſaid, the Prieſt goes with his hands ioynd, to the middle of the altar, and there bowes himſelfe lowe, ſaying,
<q>
                     <p>Holy Trinity, receaue this oblation which we offer vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thee in memory of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation, nativity, circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, paſſion, reſurrection, &amp; aſcenſio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of our Lord Ieſus Chriſt, and in honour of the ever bleſſed virgin Mary, &amp; of S.

               <p>He ſpeakes not a word of the Roman faith, although the Canon be of <hi>Gelaſius</hi> making, who ordained that the Prieſt ſhould beginne vpon his knees, hauing his hands ioyned: then before theſe words <hi>haec dona,</hi> he ſhould lift vp himſelfe, kiſſe the altar, make three ſignes of the croſſe vpon the hoſt, and the chalice, afterwards open wide his hands, and lift the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> vp a little in ſaying, <hi>tibi offerimus,</hi> in the plurall number, and therefore he is not the ſole ſacrificer but the people alſo, as indeed he ſaid before, <hi>my ſacrifice and yours.</hi> Likewiſe from theſe words, <hi>theſe gifts, theſe preſents,</hi> may be gathered, that in the time which this Canon was made (what corruption ſoever raigned) they intended not to offer vp Ieſus vnto God his Father. For then they would not haue ſpoken in the plurall number, hauing but one Ieſus. Thirdly, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore doth he tearme it a ſpotleſſe ſacrifice or incorruptible, whereas both experience and the cautells of the Maſſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned haue taught vs,<note place="margin">Cant. item ſi cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus.</note> that the conſecrated hoſt doth putrifie, that it is eaten ſometimes of rats, &amp; ſometimes breedeth wormes, which cannot proceed from an accident without a ſubſtance, neither from a glorified body. Ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impietie is committed there, in that it is ſaid, that this oblation of bread is made for the pacification of the church, as if it were as yet divorced from God, contrary to that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By one ſole oblation he hath conſecra<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ted for ever thoſe which are ſanctified.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 10.11.</note> Whence it followeth that there remaines nothing but onely the applying vnto our ſelues of that ſacrifice by faith, and not to reiterate it as if it were vnſufficient. Fiftly, with what boldneſſe dares the Prieſt make the Pope Gods companion in the goverment of the Church, which hath no head but Ieſus Chriſt her Spowſe, nor other conductor but the holy Ghoſt? For ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Church is a body Catholike and vniverſall, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in heaven and in earth, and compoſed both of dead and liuing, what other head then Chriſt is capable to ſway ſuch an Empire, and to inſpire every member of the viſible and inviſible Church. The laſt abuſe is politike, in that the Prieſt places the Pope and his Biſhop before Kings, it being the
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:1522:34"/> doctrine of theſe kinde of men, that principalities lye vnder his pantable, and that ſcepters are held by way of homage from the perforated chaire, which notwithſtanding is not practiſed throughout. As for the reformed Churches, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though they haue kings now and then which governe not ſo well; yet their practiſe is alwaies to make prayers firſt for kings and ſuperiour powers: afterwards for the Church and every member thereof, that it may bee deliuered from this papall tyranny.

Lets ſet downe therefore that which wee are to beleeue in this communion, and then by way of oppoſition we ſhall knowe the abuſes. It was inſtituted in generall for the commemoration of the death of Chriſt, to celebrate the graces which he purchaſed for vs, to ratifie his alliance, to receaue the pledge, ſeale, and aſſurance of a better life, to make proteſtation of that obedience which wee owe vnto God; and of the vnion which wee haue with all the Saints, particularly, to receaue the nouriſhment of our ſoules, to feele that we are vnited to our head and Lord, Ieſus Chriſt, that we are one with him, as he is with God the Father: and that we are bone of his bones, and fleſh of his fleſh: that we inioy him intirely, and all his benefits, to wit, his wiſdome, Iuſtice, ſanctification and redemption. So the vnion which we haue with him is tearmed ſubſtantiall in regard of the things vnited, reall, in regard of the truth of the vnion, and its effect, and ſpirituall in regard of the meanes by which this vnion is made, which are the ſpirit and faith: but as for the forme, that is incomprehenſible vnto vs: thus farre wee muſt goe, that wee preſcribe not vnto God an impanation, concomitancy, tranſubſtantiatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, or other chimeraes which favour of impiety and idolatry.</p>

So that if one would demand how the bread is the body of Chriſt, we are to anſwer, that it is in the ſame manner as the cup is his bloud, without changing of the ſubſtance. This bread is the body of Chriſt, as circumciſion was the covenant, for it is added,<note place="margin">Gen. 17.10.</note> 
                     <hi>and it ſhall be a token of the covenant betwixt mee and you.</hi> So then the ſigne taketh the name of the thing ſignified as when it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Exod. 11.12. 1. Cor. 10 4. Tit. 3.5. Ioh. 3.6. Numb. 10. 1. Cor. 5.</note>

All which manner of ſpeeches although they be in ſacramentall matters, yet are they not litterally to be vnderſtood, but doe receaue a ſacramentall interpretation. Which is the cauſe why the Doctors &amp; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtours of the Church haue called the ſacraments, <hi>types, anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>types, figures, ſimilitudes, ſignifications, images, &amp; repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</hi> You ſhall ſee hereafter more varietie of the Doctors teſtimonies.

                  <pb n="63" facs="tcp:1522:39"/>
                  <p>Another Claſſis of arguments againſt this pretended change, is taken from divers concluding reaſons. The firſt is this. This manner of ſpeech, <hi>this is my body,</hi> ſoundeth not, let this be, or this ſhall be my body; for theſe are not impera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue or operatiue tearmes of a new creature, no more then when it was ſaid, <hi>this is my welbeloued ſonne,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Mat. 3.17.</note> which was but a ſimple notification of that which he was before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouncing of them. It is another matter when it is ſaid,<note place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> 
                     <hi>Let there be light, increaſe and multiplie,</hi> for theſe are not meere enuntiations of things which are, but powerfull tearmes to create that which was not.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond reaſon is drawne from the order which our Saviour vſed, in taking, bleſſing, and breaking, before he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared in words that which he preſented; for to what ende tooke he it but to bleſſe it? and to what end bleſſed he it, but to ſanctifie it? Now if that bleſſing had his force, it is falſe to ſay that by the pronouncing of the laſt word <hi>Meum,</hi> the conſecration is made; for if it were ſo hee ſhould not haue ſaid, <hi>this is,</hi> but this <hi>ſhall be</hi> my body. For when hee would doe a miracle, he ſaid <hi>Lazarus come forth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Ioh. 11.44.</note> and not <hi>Lazarus</hi> is come forth. For that was a tearme to doe, and not to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare what was done.</p>
                  <p>The third reaſon is taken from the tearmes themſelues, for <hi>this is my body,</hi> is not as much as <hi>this is my body and bloud,</hi> which neceſſarily they muſt acknowledge, if the bread bee tranſubſtantiated into Ieſus, and ſo they ſhall haue good ſtore of rhetoricall figures: which notwithſtanding the Prieſts reiect in theſe words. In the ſame manner one might ſay as much of <hi>this cup is the new Teſtament,</hi> for in it there be many degrees of figuratiue interpretations, firſt a <hi>metonymie</hi> for by the <hi>Cup,</hi> they vnderſtand the wine which is within it, and by the wine the bloud: then a <hi>Synecdoche,</hi> for by the bloud they vnderſtand all Chriſt, both his body and ſoule, &amp; notwithſtanding it is contrary to that which our Saviour would preſent and repreſent, for by the bread is repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted only the communion of the body, and by the cup the communion of the bloud of our Lord: &amp; this is that which

As the bread is the proper food of our body, and is eaten corporally, ſo the body of Chriſt is the food of the ſpirit and is ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten spiritually.</hi> And the ſame bringeth in our Saviour ſpea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, <hi>Thoſe are preſent with me whoſe faith is with mee, and whoſe portion I am:</hi> and S. <hi>Auguſtine, Some will queſtion how I ſhall enioy it being abſent? how I ſhall ſtretch forth my hand thither where he ſits, and hold him there? ſend thither thy faith, and thou takeſt hold of him, thy forefathers enioyed him in the fleſh, enioy thou him by faith.</hi> Our Saviour himſelfe interpret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to drinke and eat by the ſame tearmes, to come and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue.</p>
                  <p>The twelfth reaſon is taken from the nature of the bodie, and from the manner of the phraſe, <hi>to be in a place.</hi> For if the naturall body borne of the Virgin be in the Sacrament, it is then either definitiuely, as the Angels be in a place, and ſo it will haue no true body, which ought to fill a place, or
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:1522:41"/> elſe it will be there repletiuely, and ſo in as much as it is a naturall body, it ſhould be there viſibly and palpably. For by being rayſed againe, and glorified it looſeth not the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of a true body, for Chriſt ſaid himſelfe, <hi>Touch and ſee,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luk. 24.29.</note> 
                     <hi>for a ſpirit hath not fleſh nor bones, as I haue.</hi> It remaineth therefore that Chriſt is there by the virtue of his divinity, which is every where (as ſaith S. <hi>Auguſtine</hi>) although his fleſh bee in heauen, and no otherwiſe then as we ſay the ſunne to bee preſent with vs when the light thereof com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth through the windowes, although the body thereof be fixed in the heauens.</p>
                  <p>The thirteenth reaſon is, that if the eating of the body of Chriſt be carnall, all the faithfull which liued before the comming of our Saviour be damned, becauſe they bee dead before they eat the body of Chriſt. For it is written, <hi>If you eat not the fleſh of the ſonne of man, and drinke not his bloud, there is no life in you.</hi> But we are aſſured that they were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, by the words of our Saviour concerning the boſome of <hi>Abraham,</hi> and by other teſtimonies and examples of <hi>Moſes, Enoch, Elias, Elizeus &amp;c:</hi> from whence wee muſt conclude that they eat Ieſus Chriſt, it being written in expreſſe terms, <hi>that all our Fathers did eat the ſame ſpirituall meat,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.4.</note> 
                     <hi>and did all drinke of the ſame ſpirituall drinke, and that the rocke whereof they dranke was Chriſt.</hi> Now before his nativitie they drank him not carnally, and therefore it followeth that they did eat it by faith, and that ſuch a kind of eating is ſufficient vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſalvation, conſidering that by it alone they were ſaued, being bound notwithſtanding to eat it.</p>
                  <p>The fourteenth is taken from the effect of tranſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for if the bread be made fleſh by virtue of thoſe wordes which are pronounced by the Prieſt, it continues to be fleſh vnleſſe either by contrary words one diſſubſtantiats it, whereof we haue no example, or the incredulitie of the wicked receauer doth diſanull that which the conſecration had created: For otherwiſe the wicked which receaue the ſacrament ſhould be infallibly ſaved, and none of them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue condemnation, in regard that the promiſe is generall,

                     <hi>the ſame hath life everlaſting,</hi> and that of S. <hi>Augustine, when Chriſt is eaten, life is eaten.</hi> Againe, <hi>The ſacrament is life vnto every man, &amp; is death vnto none, whoſoever he be which receaueth it.</hi> For if it might be (ſaith <hi>Origen</hi> vpon the 15 chap, of Mat.) that the wicked ſhould eat the word which is made fleſh, it had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver beene written, whoſoever ſhall eat this bread ſhall liue eternally. The reaſon hereof is evident; for ſeeing that the fleſh and bloud are eaten only by the faithful, and are recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued only by faith, this body cannot bee eaten vnworthily.

                     <hi>We are not to conceaue that the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked doe eat the body of Chriſt; although hee carnally and viſibly doe breake with his teeth the ſignes of the body and bloud.</hi> Note that he ſaith ſignes, for S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith not, whoſoeuer eateth this body vnworthyly, <hi>but whoſoeuer eateth of this bread, &amp; drinketh of this cup.</hi> Which eating of the meere ſigne, is ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, to make any man culpable which approacheth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthily, and reiecteth the grace which his prince offereth him, trampling vnder foot his armes, and iniuring his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadour;<note place="margin">Heb. 10.26.28.</note> which are no leſſe then crymes of high nature of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his ſacred maieſtie.

So Iudas eate the bread of the Lord, but not the bread which is the Lord,</hi> ſaith <hi>Innocent.</hi> Whence it followeth that there is no tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation, conſidering that after the conſecration he ſpeaketh of two breades, the one <hi>Panis domini,</hi> the bread of the Lord, which is the wheaten loafe, the other <hi>Panis Dominus,</hi> the bread which is the Lord, to wit, the true body of Ieſus Chriſt: the one in Heauen, the other on earth; the one recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued with the hand and the mouth of the body, the other with faith, which is the hand and mouth of the ſoule, the
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:1522:42"/> one offered by the miniſter of the Church, the other by Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt himſelfe. Wherefore S, <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>that he which eateth and drinketh vnworthily, diſcerneth not the Lords bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</hi> Where to diſcerne, διακρίνειν, is as much as to ſeparate the one from the other, and to haue a diuers reſpect of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: for if there be but one, there can be neither diſcerning nor diſtinguiſhing.</p>
                  <p>The ſixteenth reaſon is taken from hence, that the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended change made by the pronouncing of words, will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe them, in that they haue not the power to change as wel the accidents as the ſubſtance, nor to conuert the forme as well as the matter.

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſeuenteenth is taken from that which the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>You ſhall declare the Lords death vntill his comming.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1. Cor. 11.26.</note> For if we are not to celebrate this action but vntill his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming, by a conſequent there ought not to bee any more Maſſes ſaid; for according to the Prieſts doctrine Chriſt hath often deſcended already vnto vs.</p>
                  <p>The eightenth is, that we are not to celebrat the memory of things preſent, but of thoſe which are abſent; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſeeing that this is a commemoration of Ieſus Chriſt, it followeth that he is not there carnally preſent.</p>
                  <p>The nineteenth is taken from the letter, to which the Prieſts ſo much ſticke; for <hi>this is my body,</hi> makes not whole Chriſt, and conſequently the Prieſt in pronouncing thoſe words, vnderſtands him not wholly; and therefore ought not to adore him as is before ſaid, <hi>Numb.</hi> 23.</p>
                  <p>The twentieth reaſon is taken from the teſtimony of <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rill,</hi> before cited, <hi>that the Sacrament is life vnto euery man,</hi>

                  <p>The laſt reaſon is taken from hence, that our Sauiour ought to be adored with one onely kinde of adoration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after his incarnation; for the incarnation cannot be a cauſe of a new worſhip, ſuch as is in the Maſſe, which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dures no longer then the ſpecies doe ſubſiſt without putri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying: whereas the onely and true adoration due to our Lord, is due onely to the Perſon of Chriſt, wherein two na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are inſeparably vnited. Wherefore the Epheſian Creed made againſt <hi>Paulus Damaſetanus,</hi> and tranſlated out of Greeke into Latin by <hi>Peltanus</hi> the Ieſuite, ſaith, <hi>We confeſſe that Ieſus Chriſt our Lord ought to be entirely adored, with his body, but not according to his body.</hi> For this reaſon the Arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans haue beene called idolaters by <hi>Athanaſius, Cyrill</hi> and <hi>Theodoret,</hi> becauſe they adored a god, which they ſaid, was created.<note place="margin">§.

Likewiſe <hi>Neſtorius</hi> beleeuing our Sauiour to be man ſuſtaining the God-head, hath been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned as an Heretique: much more reaſon is there to brand with ſuch a title thoſe which beleeue the ſimple acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents doe ſuſtaine a body and a ſoule, euen the whole en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire diuinity, and who ordaine an adoration of Sacraments,
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:1522:43"/> and things viſible and temporall, which are not God inuiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, eternall, infinite, neither our Sauiour in his naturall exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtence, who is at the right hand of God, farre differing from a ſacramentall exiſtence, which the Councell of Trent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth cannot be expreſſed, in which regard one may ſay vnto them, <hi>You know not that which you adore, but wee know that which we worſhip,</hi> euen Ieſus which is God inuiſible, made man like vnto vs in all things, ſinne onely excepted, Now this new adoration was inſtituted by <hi>Honorius</hi> the 3. about the yeare 1225, and the prayer vnto it is preſcribed in the gloſſe, <hi>Salue lux mundi, &amp;c.

                     <hi>entire deity, true man, &amp;c.</hi> And although this adoration bee ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed directly to the hoaſte, yet the Prieſt knowes well that it is differing from Ieſus Chriſt, not onely in regard of the termes aboue mentioned, to wit, that he is called a pure Sacrament, and a temporall gift, but alſo in reſpect of the prayer which he makes, <hi>Let the office of my ſeruitude pleaſe thee, holy Trinity, &amp;c. and grant that the ſacrifice offered by me, be agreeable vnto thee, &amp;c: through Ieſus Chriſt.</hi> Now I ſay that if this hoaſte were Ieſus Chriſt himſelfe, we ought not to ſay, let Ieſus be agreeable through Ieſus; for men im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy not the interceſſion of a thing, to the thing it ſelfe. Moreouer Ieſus Chriſt was not Mediatour for himſelfe to God, for betweene the Perſons of the Trinity there is no mediation; but betweene the hoaſte and him to whom it is offered, a kinde of mediation is ſuggeſted; for in the ſame moment, the Prieſt throwes himſelfe below the hoaſte to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore it, and aboue it, intercedes for it to God, that it may be acceptable vnto him, ſo that he makes two Chriſts, the one at the right hand of the Father inuocated and prayed vnto, and the other in the hands of the Prieſt, ſupplicating and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending to finde grace, the one vnto whom the ſacrifice is offered, and the other which is ſacrificed. Whence appeares a manifeſt idolatry; for there is but one onely adoration of the ſame eſſence, which receiues neither more nor leſſe, neither differeth from it ſelfe either in ſubſtance or acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>

                  <p>The next order of arguing againſt this pretended tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiation, is taken from the analogy of the Sacraments, which are viſible ſignes and ſeales of the inuiſible grace of God, ſo that the ſigne is a thing differing in his owne nature from that which it ſignifies, as the water in Baptiſme, which although it be a Sacrament of bloud, yet is it not tranſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantiated.<note place="margin">Can. quia paſſus in fine de conſec. diſt. <hi>2.</hi>
                     </note> And the Popes themſelues heerein agree with vs, ſaying, <hi>We are not to doubt that euery faithfull man is made partaker of the body and of the cup, when hee is baptiſed, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though he dye before he receiue the Euchariſt,</hi> and marke the reaſon added thereunto, <hi>becauſe hee hath in himſelfe that which this Sacrament ſignifies.</hi> The ſame may bee ſaide of the Sacraments, of the Paſſeouer, the Rocke, the Arke, in which the Lambe was not changed into the Paſſeouer, nor the Rocke into Chriſt, nor the Arke into the Couenant, notwithſtanding they contayned the truth of that which they prefigured, and they which were partakers of them, did really enioy that which was repreſented by them.<note place="margin">Ibid.

                     </label> There remaine now the Obiections, whereof the firſt is, that vnder the Ghoſpell all figures ceaſe. Where wee muſt diſtinguiſh of figures, for ſometimes they are taken for Rhetoricall figures and manners of ſpeech, which they call <hi>Tropes,</hi> and thoſe ceaſe not, for the Ghoſpell is full of them; as for example, Ieſus is called the <hi>Lambe,</hi> the <hi>Hedge,</hi> the <hi>way,</hi> by a Metaphore, and euen in this place the cuppe is taken for the wine by a Metonomie. Sometimes figures are taken for the ceremonies of the Law, which prefigured Chriſt and his ſacrifice. Theſe indeed ceaſe in the reformed Churches, but not in the Romane. For if wee may beleeue <hi>Biell, Titleman</hi> and others, there were neuer more figures vnder the olde Law, then are now vnder the new. See the ſignifications of the Altar, the kiſſing of it, the right hand, and the left, the turnings of the Prieſt, the ſignes, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſignifications and inuentions, which wee know not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding to haue ceaſed. Wee anſwere therefore that figures doe not ceaſe in the former ſignification, but the later.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond obiection is taken from the omnipotency of God, who is able to make a body to be every where, to bee inviſible, and exiſte without its accidents. To this wee muſt anſwer, that by this argument <hi>Mahumet</hi> and his abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be maintained, for God is able to doe any thing. But before we imploy this omnipotency, we ought to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, if ſuch be his will, and then wee may boldly conclude that hee can doe it; for the propoſition is not convertible, God can doe all that he will,<note place="margin">Aug. Euchirid. c. <hi>96.</hi>
                     </note> and God will doe all that hee can. This is taught vs by S. <hi>Auguſtine, God is not called omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent for any other reaſon, then for that hee is able to doe all that which he is willing to doe, and that the effect of his will can not be hindred by the will and effect of any other creature.</hi> And <hi>Tertullian,</hi>

                  <p>The errour of this verſe, conſiſts in that the Prieſt would take the temporall gift, which is the bread, with a pure ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. For the bread is not taken with the ſpirit, but with the mouth, and we ought not to confound the ſigne with the thing ſignified, but ought to ſay, as the mouth taketh this bread, ſo grant that the ſpirit may partake of thy body. The ſecond point is deciſiue, againſt the pretended tranſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation; for although this prayer be made after the conſecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and after the reception, yet the Prieſt confeſſeth that that which before he adored was but a temporall gift, and craueth that it may be vnto him an everlaſting remedy: for if it were the body of Chriſt, what needs hee demand that it might become a remedy? and if the conſecration did make it to be ſuch in ſubſtance, ſhould it not be a ſpirituall reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy?
